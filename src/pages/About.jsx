        Why this exists
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes you just feel stuck. Not in a &quot;I need to be more productive&quot; way —
        in a &quot;I don&apos;t know what to do with myself right now&quot; way. That&apos;s okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn&apos;t about doing more. It&apos;s not a productivity tool. It&apos;s not here to
        optimize you or track streaks or make you feel like you should be achieving
        something. It&apos;s just a gentle nudge when you need one — like a friend
        suggesting you drink some water or take a breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing nothing is allowed. Skipping suggestions is allowed. The only goal here
        is to offer small, kind ideas for when you want them. No judgment, no
        pressure, no analysis.
